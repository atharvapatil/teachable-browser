### Motivation
Every year in fall students study Introduction to Computational Media at ITP. Part of learning is watching tutorial videos which extend anywhere between 10 mins to a couple of hours. As the viewing progresses peoples posture starts slouching or takes many weird forms including sitting in weird angles, leaning over the table & more. With teachable machines pose classifier I saw an opportunity to enable conscious healthy seating choices in people by giving them feedback when they have a bad posture.
